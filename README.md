# Roblox Developers Bot (RDB) Proposals
A central place for change request for RDB, our Discord server management bot.

# Proposing a change
Developers, staff, and server members may create an Issue using one of the provided templates or participate in Discussions about the bot's design.

When creating a proposal:

- Fill out all parts of the template.
- Keep it short and simple.
- Feel free to use Discord related terminology, but avoid other forms of jargon.
- Avoid providing an implementation unless absolutely necessary.

# Rules
Roblox Developers Discord rules also apply here. In addition we ask that you:

- Only use this repository to discuss RDB and related material.
- Don't post Issues or discuss proposals that would break our rules or never be implemented.

# Staff use
Be mindful that staff also use this repository and have the final say on what gets worked on
and in what order.
